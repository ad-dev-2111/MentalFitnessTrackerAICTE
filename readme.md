The project aims to develop a Mental Fitness Tracker Regression Model to analyse mental health trends globally. The agenda includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, regression model building, and model evaluation. The model will identify factors influencing mental fitness, predict mental fitness levels based on mental health and lifestyle data, and provide insights for targeted mental health interventions and awareness campaigns
